# Language-Reference-Sheets
Sheets that summarise my knowledge of various languages into dense sheets for quick reference or study.

### These sheets are not for people just getting started; they will not teach you to code.

They summarise features and quirks to provide a quicker push start into a new language, or to serve as a reminder.
The target audience is people who are competent with coding, but are using or learning a language they're not completely familliar with.

This is intended to go hand in hand with learning first party reading and documentation.
__This should absolutely not be your primary learning source.__
